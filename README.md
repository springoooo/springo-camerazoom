# springo-camerazoom
A STANDALONE resource that simulates providing focus / zooming in, inspired by Prodigy RP 2.0

# Preview:
- Coming shortly

# Installation:
Please follow the below steps to properly install this into your FiveM server:
- Download the resource by cloning it from the github repository, or simply download from the releases page.
- Extract resource files, and it is a simple drag and drop into your resources directory
- Do not forget to `ensure springo-camerazoom` in your server.cfg
- Make sure to edit the config to your liking.

# Usage:
- To zoom in, press the middle-mouse-button, and it will zoom in by default, or whatever key you have set in the config file.
- That's pretty much it! When you hold the key, it stays zoomed in, let go, you aren't zoomed in anymore. 

# Resmon:
Standard resmon sits at 0.00 at idle and 0.03 while in use. Feel free to optimise thread if you feel, however, I have not tested this. Maybe in the future
